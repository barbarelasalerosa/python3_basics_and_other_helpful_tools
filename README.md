# python3_basics_and_other_helpful_tools

This is/is going to be repository with different tools written in Python/python3, which will be for beginners or those who are just reglular python-enthusiasts.

First tool is showing a simple way how to manage your future registration(s) and login(s) for other and more mature projects :):) 

!!! This is "the key" knowledge for python-beginners, because you will sooner or later meet with libraries such as: re (Regex) that can help you with creating specific patterns for matching certain strings and texts. 

Next, we will meet with libraries like phonenumbers, email_validator, ftplib etc. Some of them have not been used yet in this tool (log_in.py), but....
Later, as we continue to build this petit project for python-beginners, we will encounter with more than above mentioned.

Second tool shows us several types of basic cryptography in python that can help you to learn more, and to search more, about not only cryptography in python, but CRYPTOGRAPHY itself.

This is just a beginning! Stay tuned with BaRbArElA-sAlErOsA
